## Custom Colored Labels for Pivotal Tracker

First off, this project is heavily inspired by https://github.com/mkenyon/red-labels-for-pivotal-tracker.

Our team has for different apps in one PT project (yeah, we know you can have more projects). In Jira, we could tag each story with a component, and that would give it a colored hint. So, we could easily see in a sprint, how much work was being applied to each of our products. So, this colors the labels we are adding to denote which app is being worked on for a specific story.
